Perkinput is a Braille-based iPhone application for text entry.  The app allows someone to quickly enter text using multi-finger taps (chords), one tap per column of Braille. The app allows the user to copy the entered text into a text message, email body, or clipboard.  Perkinput does use a keyboard.  Instead, the user registers finger locations by holding fingers down on the screen, then tap in Braille characters in roughly the same finger locations. A study with blind users has shown Perkinput to be nearly twice as fast as text entry using a soft keyboard with VoiceOver.
